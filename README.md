# battleScribeDecks
App that takes BattleScribe Rosters and formats them in a deck-of-cards type unit list
Hello there! This is my first ever personal App project. The aim of this project is to create an army roster for Warhammer 40k that can be viewed through like a deck of cards. Each unit will be represented on a card, including images of that unit and all it's stats and rules.
